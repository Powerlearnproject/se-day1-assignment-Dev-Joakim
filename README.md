# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering isthe process of desinging, developing, testing and maintaining of software systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.development of the first programming languages- it included the creation of fist programming languages like fotrain
2.Birth of structured programming- it included the introduction of structured programming by donald knuth
3. the emagence of agile methodologies - it formalised a new approach to software development


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.problem defination- clealy describes the problem or need that the system aims to solve.
2.preliminary investigation -it involves the system anlysit ivestigating the current system with a view of desing a new system.
3.system desing -involves the requirements into a form that can be implementing into a system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
watefall methodology is a linear, sequensial development process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next one while Agile methodologyis a flexible and iterative aproach to software development that emphisizes collaboration, customer feedback etc

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.softwaredeveloper - a software developer is responsible for writing code that makes up the software product.
2.QA engineer - is responsible for ensuring the qualityof the softwareproduct.
3.project manager -is responsible for overseeing the entire software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
they are essential tools in mordern software development that significally improve productivity,collaboration and workflows by providing developers with steamlined workflows.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. debugging and troubleshooting - heving the eeffective debugging tools
2. balancing speed and quality - set automatic testing


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing-it involves testing indivinduals units or componentsof a software apllication in isolation
2. intergration testing -involves the interaction between multiple components
3. system test - it is testing the complete system as a whole to ensure that everything works

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promt engineering refers to the process of desinging and optimizing input prompt to communicate effectively with ai models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
